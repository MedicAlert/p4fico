# P4FICO #
----------

P4F driven glyhpic artwork. The purpose of this project is to offer a community with a wide-array of game-centric items. 

P4FICO falls under the MIT license and to comply with the license, P4FICO is completely free to the public and can be tinkered with in any form or fashion. **I only ask modifiers to respect BRANDED names, such as Electronic Arts and EAsy Studios when changing artwork.**

## File Structure ##


P4FICO is structured very simply -

    ├── main (master directory)
		├──	png (parent directory - 100x100 px)
			├── black (black coloured glyphs)
			├── white (white coloured glyphs)
		├── svg (parent directory - 100x100 px default)
			├── black (default colour of the svg format is black)
		├── future (contains only wip [work in progress] and list of suggestions)
	├── example
		├── xcf (contains examples for best showcase)
		├── showcase (contains possible examples of clients that can use this set)

All commits done must respect this file structure in order to keep every organized.

If you have any suggestions or comments on the project, feel free to contact me on my personal email: [vijaythinks@gmail.com](mailto:vijaythinks@gmail.com) or on an external forum thread: Thread

## Download and Packaging ##

I feel like people shouldn't be forced to re-download a package just because one little image has been added. This is why I used GitHub; You can download individual files when they are released and marked off the future directory. 

Major releases will be in increments of 50, but the addition to the official website [P4FICO](http://www.shadyorange.com/tools/p4fico) will be continuous.
